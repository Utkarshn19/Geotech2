    <h3>Procedure ( IS-2720-Part-28 (1975))</h3>
    <h3>Stage1 –Determination of mass of sand that fills the cone</h3>
    <p>a) Measure the internal dimensions (diameter, d and height, h) of the calibratingcan and compute its internal volume, Vc=πd2h/4 f) The difference between the mass of sand taken prior to opening of the valve and the weight of sand left in the cylinder after opening the valve gives the weight of sand that fills the cone. Let the mass be W1 </p>

      <p>  b) With the valve closed, fill the cylinder withsand
        Weight of sand filled in the cylinder+cylinder W’=--------gms. </p>
        
      <p>  c) Keep the cylinder on a glass plate, which is kept on a horizontalsurface. </p>
        
      <p>  d) Open the valve and allow the sand to fill the cone completely. Close thevalve. <br>
        Weight of sand in the cylinder +cylinder W”=-----gmsp  </p>

        
      <p>  e) Determine the mass of the sand left in thecylinder. Weight of sand fills the conicalportion=W1=W’-W”  </p>
        
     <p>   f) The difference between the mass of sand taken prior to opening of the valve and the weight of sand left in the cylinder after opening the valve gives the weight of sand that fills the cone. Let the mass be W1 </p>
        
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Determination of bulk density of sand </p>

         <p>   a) Measure the internal dimensions of the calibrating container and find itsvolume. <br>
            Length of calibrating containerl=------------cm <br>
            Diameter of calibrating container d=---------cm <br>
            Volume of calibrating container Vc=---------cm3 <br>
            Let this volume be Vc. </p>
            
        <p>    b) Place the pouring cylinder concentrically on the top of the calibrating container with the valve closed. Fill the cylinder with sand up to about 1 cm below the top. <br>
            Weight of cylinderW1=-------g <br>
            Weight of cylinder +sand in the cylinder W2=-------g <br>
            Weight of sand filled in the cylinder Wo=W2-W1=-------g <br>
            Let the weight of sand filled be Wo. </p>
            
         <p>   c) Open the valve of the cylinder and allow the sand to flow into the container. When no further movement of sand is seen, close the valve. Find the weight of the sand left in the cylinder <br>
            Weight of cylinder +sand after filling the calibrating container W3=-------gms. <br>
            Determine the weight of sand that fills the calibrating container Wc=W2-W3=-----  </p>
            
         <p>   d) The bulk density of sand *sis <br>
            *s = Wc/ Vc</p>

            <h3>Stage 2 - Determination of in-situ density:</h3>
            <p>a) Level the area where the density isrequired. </p>

             <p>   b) Place the metal plate on the surface, which is having a circular hole of about 10 cm diameter at the centre. Dig a hole of this diameter up to about 15 cm depth collect all the excavated soil in a container. <br>
                Let the weight of the soil removed = W2=----------g</p>
                
            <p>    Remove the plate and place the sand-pouring cylinder concentrically on the hole. Fill the cylinder with sand up to a constant level mark with the shutter valve closed. Open the valve and allow the sand to run into the hole till no movement of the sand is noticed. Close the valve and determine the mass of sand that is left in the cylinder <br>
                Weight of cylinder+sand after filling the hole completely W4=----g <br>
                Weight of sand filling only the hole in the field Ws=W2-W4-Wc=------g <br>
                Volume of the hole, Vh = Ws/ *s where *s = bulk density of sand. </p>
                
              <p>  d) Bulk density of soil in-situ, *t,is *t = W/ Vh = (W/ Ws)* *s</p>

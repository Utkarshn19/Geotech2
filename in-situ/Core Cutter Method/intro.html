    <h3>Aim:</h3>
    <p>To determine the field density or unit weight of soil by Core cutter method. <br>
        Field density is used in calculating the stress in the soil due to its overburde pressure. It is needed in estimating the bearing capacity of soil foundation system, settlement of footing, earth pressures behind the retaining walls and embankments. Stability of natural slopes, dams, embankments and cuts is checked with the help of density of soil. It is the density that controls the field compaction of soils. Permeability of soils depends upon its density. Relative density of cohesionless soils is determined by knowing the dry density of soil in natural, loosest and densest states. Void ratio, porosity and degree of saturation need the help of density of soil.</p>

        <h3>Specification:</h3>
        <p>This test is done to determine the in-situ dry density of soil by core cutter method as per IS-2720-Part-29 (1975). Core cutter method in particular, is suitable for soft to medium cohesive soils, in which the cutter can be driven. It is not possible to drive the cutter into hard and boulder soils.

            </p>
            <h3>Theory:</h3>
            <p>Field density is defined as weight per unit volume of soil mass in the field at in-situ conditions. In the spot adjacent to that where the field density by sand replacement method has been determined or planned, drive the core cutter using the dolley over the core cutter. Stop ramming when the dolley is just proud of the surface. Dig out the cutter containing the soil out of the ground and trim off any solid extruding from its ends, so that the cutter contains a volume of soil equal to its internal volume which is determined from the dimensions of the cutter. The weight of the contained soil is found and its moisture content determined.
            </p>
            <p>Equations are; <br>

                ρd = ρt /(1+w) gm/cm³ <br>
                
                Where, <br>
                ρd = dry density in g/cm3, <br>
                ρt = field moist density in g/cm3 , <br>
                w =water content %/100, <br>
                ϒw = density of water = 1000</p>

    <h3>Relevent IS Code :- IS 2720-17 (1986)</h3>
    <h3>Procedure :</h3>
    <p>1. A constant-head test assembly is as given in below figure. </p>

    <p>   2. Select a representative soil mass of about 2.5 kg properly mixed. </p>
        
    <p>   3. Fill the soil into the mould and compact it to the required dry density by making use of a suitable compacting device. </p>
        
    <p>   4. Set the assembly as shown in figure after saturating the porous stones. </p>
        
    <p>   5. The water supply is properly adjusted to maintain constant head.</p>
        
    <p>   6. Open the valve and saturate the sample by allowing water to flow through for a sufficiently long time to remove all air-bubbles. </p>
        
    <p>   7. When the whole setup is ready for the test, open the valve, allow the water to flow through the sample collect water in a graduated jar starting simultaneously a stopwatch. Note the time to collect a certain quantity of water Q. </p>
        
    <p>  8. Repeat the test three times and determine the average of Q for the same time intervalt. </p>
        
    <p>   9. Measure the head h, length of sample L, and calculate the cross sectional area A of the sample. </p>
        
    <p>  10. Calculate k by making use of equation.</p>

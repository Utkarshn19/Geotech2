        <h3>Aim:</h3>
        <p>To determine the grain size distribution of the given soil by dry sieving.</p>
    <h3>Need and Scope:</h3>
    <p>The results of testing will reflect the condition and characteristics of the aggregate from which the sample is obtained. Therefore, when sampling, it is important to obtain a disturbed representative sample that is representative of the source being tested because the distribution of different grain sizes affects the engineering properties of soil.</p>
<h3>Theory:</h3>
<p>Soil gradation (sieve analysis) is the distribution of particle sizes expressed as a percent of the total dry weight. Gradation is determined by passing the material through a series of sieves stacked with progressively smaller openings from top to bottom and weighing the material retained on each sieve.

</p>
<p>Sieve analysis is a method that is used to determine the grain size distribution of soils that are greater than 0.075 mm in diameter. It is usually performed for sand and gravel but cannot be used as the sole method for determining the grain size distribution of finer soil. The sieves used in this method are made of woven wires with square openings.</p>

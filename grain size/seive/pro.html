    <h3>  Procedure (IS 2720-Part 4, 1985) :</h3>
    
1. Oven dry the given soil sample passing 4.75 mm IS sieve. <br>

2. Take 200 g of oven dried soil sample. Mix the sample with distilled water to form a slurry and allow it for soaking. <br>

3. Wash the soaked soil sample through 75 micron sieve until the water passing through the sieve is substantially clear. <br>

4. Dry the fraction of the soil retained on 75 micron sieve in oven. <br>

5. Arrange the remaining sieves one above the other such that 2mm sieve is at the top and 75 micron sieve is at the bottom. Place a cover at the top and receiver at the bottom. <br>

6. Fix the set of sieves to the mechanical sieve shaker. Operate the sieve shaker for a minimum of 10 minutes. <br>

7. Carefully collect and record the mass of the soil fraction retained on each sieve and also in the receiver. <br>

8. Calculate the cumulative mass of soil fraction retained on each sieve. Calculate the percentage finer. <br>

9. Plot a graph of percentage finer (along y-axis) Vs equivalent particle diameter in mm (along x-axis in log scale). Draw a smooth curve encompassing the plotted points. <br>

10. Record the values of percentage sand, percentage silt and percentage clay size fractions from the graph. <br>

11. Record D10, D30 and D60 from the graph. <br>

12. Calculate coefficient of curvature (CC) and coefficient of uniformity (CU). <br>

13. Classify the soil based on gradation. <br>

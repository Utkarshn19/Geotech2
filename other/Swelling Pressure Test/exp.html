    <h3>Apparatus Required:-</h3>
    <h3>1. Swell Pressure Test by Consolidometer:-</h3>

    <img src="1.jpg" alt="" class="imageswe">
    <p>A device to hold the sample in a ring either fixed or floating with porous stones on each face of the sample. A consolidometer shall also provide means for submerging the sample, for applying a vertical load and for measuring the change in the thickness of the specimen. The provision for fixing of the dial gauge shall be rigid and in no case shall the dial gauge be fixed to a cantilevered arm. The dial gauges shall be fixed in such a way to record the vertical expansion of the specimen.</p>
    <p> (a) Specimen Diameter: 60mm. <br>

        (b) Specimen Thickness: Shall be at least 20mm in all cases. However, the thickness shall not be less than 10 times the maximum diameter of the grain in the soil specimen. The diameter to thickness ratio shall be a minimum of 3. <br>
        
        (c) Ring: The ring shall be made of non-corrosive material. <br>
        
        (d) Porous Stones: The stones shall be of silicon carbide or aluminium oxide and of medium grade. It shall have a high permeability compared to that of the soil being tested. The diameter of the top stone shall be 0.2 to 0.5mm less than the internal diameter of the ring</p>

        <h3>2. Swell Pressure Test by Constant Volume Method:</h3>
        <img src="2.jpg" alt="" class="imageswe">
        <p>The arrangement for Swell Pressure Test by Constant Volume Method consists of Loading unit (5 tonnes), Proving ring (with high sensitivity, 200 kg capacity) along with all Apparatus as used in Consolidometer method.

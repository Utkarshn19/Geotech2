    <h3>Aim:</h3>
    <p>To determine moisture content –DRY DENSITY RELATIONSHIP BY STANDARD PROCTOR TEST.
        Compaction is the application of mechanical energy to a soil so as to rearrange its particles and reduce the void ratio. It is applied to improve the properties of an existing soil or in the process of placing fill such as in the construction of embankments, road bases, runways, earth dams, and reinforced earth walls. Compaction is also used to prepare a level surface during construction of buildings. There is usually no change in the water content and in the size of the individual soil particles.</p>
<h3>Specifications :-</h3>
<p>The experiment is conducted as per IS 2720-7(1980).</p>
<h3>Theory:-</h3>
<p>The objectives of compaction are:</p>
<p>a) To increase soil shear strength and therefore its bearing capacity. <br>
    b) To reduce subsequent settlement under working loads. <br>
    c) To reduce soil permeability making it more difficult for water to flow through</p>
<p>To assess the degree of compaction, it is necessary to use the dry unit weight, which is an indicator of compactness of solid soil particles in a given volume. The laboratory testing is meant to establish the maximum dry density that can be attained for a given soil with a standard amount of compactive effort.</p>

<p>1. Bulk density ϒt =(M2-M1)/V <br>
    2. Dry density ρd = ρt/(1 +w) <br>
    3. Dry density ρd for zero air voidsline. ρd = Gρw/(1 + (wG/S))</p>

    <p>Where, M1 = mass of mould used for proctor test <br>
        M2 = mass of mould + compacted soil. <br>
        M = mass of wet soil. <br>
        V = volume of mould. <br>
        ρw = density of water. <br>
        G = Specific gravity of soils. <br>
        W = water content. <br>
        S = degree of saturation</p>

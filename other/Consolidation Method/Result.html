    <h3>CALCULATIONS:</h3>
    <p> <h3>1. Height of solids (HS) <h3>is calculated from the equation <br>

        HS = WS/G Y w A <br> </p>
        
         <p> <h3> 2. Void ratio </h3>. Voids ratio at the end of various pressures are calculated from equation <br>
        
        
        e = (H * HS)/HS </p>
        
          <p> <h3> 3.Coefficient of consolidation</h3>  The Coefficient of consolidation at each pressures increment is calculated by using the following equations : <br>
        
        i. Cv = 0.197 d2 /t50 (Log fitting method) <br>
        ii. Cv = 0.848 d2/t90 </p>
        
        (Square fitting method) In the log fitting method, a plot is made between dial reading and logarithmic of time, the time corresponding to 50% consolidation is determined. <br>
        
        In the square root fitting method, a plot is made between dial readings and square root of time and the time corresponding to 90% consolidation is determined. The values of Cv are recorded in table 2. <br>
        
         <p> <h3> 4. Compression Index. </h3>   To determine the compression index, a plot of voids ratio (e) Vs logt is made. The initial compression curve would be a straight line and the slope of this line would give the compression index Cc.</p>
        
         <p> <h3> 5. Coefficient of compressibility. </h3>   It is calculated as follows <br>
        av = 0.435 Cc/Avg. pressure for the increment <br>
        where Cc = Coefficient of compressibility  </p>
        
        <p> <h3> 6. Coefficient of permeability.</h3></p>  It is calculated as follows <br>
        K = Cv.av *(unit weight of water)/(1+e).</p>

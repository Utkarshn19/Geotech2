    <h3>Relevent IS Code :- IS 2720-15 (1965) </h3>
    <h3>    Procedure :-</h3>

    <p>1. Saturate two porous stones either by boiling in distilled water about 15 minute or by keeping them submerged in the distilled water for 4 to 8 hrs. Wipe away excess water. Fittings of the consolidometer which is to be enclosed shall be moistened. </p>

     <p>   2. Assemble the consolidometer, with the soil specimen and porous stones at top and bottom of specimen, providing a filter paper between the soil specimen and porous stone. Position the pressure pad centrally on the top porous stone. </p>
        
     <p>   3. Mount the mould assembly on the loading frame, and center it such that the load applied is axial.
        
     <p>   4. Position the dial gauge to measure the vertical compression of the specimen. The dial gauge holder should be set so that the dial gauge is in the begging of its releases run, allowing sufficient margin for the swelling of the soil, if any.  </p>
        
      <p>  5. Connect the mould assembly to the water reservoir and the sample is allowed to saturate. The level of the water in the reservoir should be at about the same level as the soil specimen.
        
    <p>    6. Apply an initial load to the assembly. The magnitude of this load should be chosen by trial, such that there is no swelling. It should be not less than 50 g/cm3 for ordinary soils & 25 g/cm2 for very soft soils. The load should be allowed to stand until there is no change in dial gauge readings for two consecutive hours or for a maximum of 24 hours. </p>
        
     <p>   7. Note the final dial reading under the initial load. Apply first load of intensity 0.1 kg/cm2 start the stop watch simultaneously. Record the dial gauge readings at various time intervals. The dial gauge readings are taken until 90% consolidation is reached. Primary consolidation is gradually reached within 24 hrs. </p>
        
    <p>    8. At the end of the period, specified above take the dial reading and time reading. Double the load intensity and take the dial readings at various time intervals. Repeat this procedure fir successive load increments. The usual loading intensity are as follows : a. 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 8 kg/cm2 . </p>
        
     <p>   9. After the last loading is completed, reduce the load to 60 % of the value of the last load and allow it to stand for 24 hrs. Reduce the load further in steps of the previous intensity till an intensity of 0.1 kg/cm2 is reached. Take the final reading of the dial gauge. </p>
        
     <p>   10.Reduce the load to the initial load, keep it for 24 hrs and note the final readings of the dial gauge. </p>
        
    <p>    11.Quickly dismantle the specimen assembly and remove the excess water on the soil specimen in oven, note the dry weight of it.</p>

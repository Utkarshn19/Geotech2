    <h3>Aim:</h3>
    <p>To determine Cohesion or Shear Strength of Soil.</p>
    <p>The structural strength ofsoil is basicallya problem ofshear strength.Vane shear test is a useful method of measuring the shear strength of clay. It is a cheaper and quicker method. The test can also be conducted in the laboratory. The laboratory vane shear test for the measurement of shear strength of cohesive soils, is useful for soils of low shear strength (less than 0.3 kg/cm2) for which triaxial or unconfined tests can not be performed. The test gives the undrained strength of the soil. The undisturbed and remoulded strength obtained are useful for evaluating the sensitivity ofsoil.
</p>
<h3>Specifications:</h3>
<p>The test is conducted as per IS 4434 (1978). This test is useful when the soil is soft and its water content is nearer to liquid limit.</p>
<h3>Theory:</h3>
<p>The vane shear test apparatus consists of four stainless steel blades fixed at right angle to each other and firmly attached to a high tensile steel rod. The length of the vane is usually kept equal to twice its overall width. The diameters and length of the stainless steel rod were limited to 2.5mm and 60mm respectively. At this time, the soil fails in shear on a cylindrical surface around the vane. The rotation is usually continued after shearing and the torque is measured to estimate the remoulded shear strength. Vane shear test can be used as a reliable in-situ test for determining the shear strength of soft-sensitive clays. The vane may be regarded as a method to be used under the following conditions. <br>

    1. Where the clay is deep, normally consolidated and sensitive. <br>
    
    2. Where only the undrained shear strength is required. <br>
    
    It has been found that the vane gives results similar to that as obtained from unconfined compression tests on undisturbed samples.</p>

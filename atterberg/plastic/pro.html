    <h3>Procedure:  (IS: 2720(Part-5) 1985 )</h3>
    <p>1. Take about 20 g of soil sample, passing 425 micron IS sieve. Mix it on the glass plate with sufficient distilled water to make it plastic enough to be shaped into a ball. Allow the soil to stand for sufficient time to ensure uniform distribution of moisture throughout the soil mass. </p>

       <p> 2. With about 8 g of soil so prepared, make a ball and roll it on the glass plate with hand, with pressure just sufficient to roll the soil mass into a thread of uniform diameter throughout its length. When the diameter of the thread reaches 3 mm, kneed the soil together to a uniform mass and once again roll it. Continue the process until the soil thread just crumbles at 3mm diameter. </p>
        
      <p>  3. Collect the crumbled soil threads in a container and determine the corresponding water content by oven drying method. </p>
        
       <p> 4. Repeat the test to have three trials. </p>
        
       <p> 5. Report the average water content rounded off to the nearest whole number as the plastic limit of the soil.</p>
